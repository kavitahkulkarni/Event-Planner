# Event-Planner
This is a web application that can be used to schedule/view the events.

This web applicated is created as part of a project for Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree program.
In this web application users can sign-up using their e-mail address.
Once the user is signed in, he/she can view all the previously created events.
User can also schedule the new events using create event option.
In addition to that, user can choose to see the events created by only themselves and their top events (events starred as favorites).

I have used Gulp to build this project for the first time and find it very convenient tool.
As part of project, I have designed 2 forms one for user sign-up and another for event creation.
This is for the first time that I am trying to use the firebase application and created a firebase project. I am using the sample code from firebase examples for authentication and DB. Also, this is for the first time I am have created multi step forms.

Code files are placed in "app" folder.
The desictribution code is in "dist" folder.

Please feel free to provide your experience and feedback.
